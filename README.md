##my::dotfiles

In the constant quest to make every machine in your image you'll need *nix config files. This repo contains my favs in a really easy to install package.

## Install
Simply run `rake` or `rake install` or `rake all:install` from within the repository. Install happens according to `~/` paths. I'll try to keep what's there, but chance are whatever bad decisions you made prior to installing these dotfiles will be forever gone. #yolo
